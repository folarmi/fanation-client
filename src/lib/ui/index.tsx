/* Ionicons outline (plus three solid pairs, for the spots that toggle a filled
   state), self-hosted under `src/assets/icons`. Raw-imported so each SVG's markup
   bundles as a plain string — Vite resolves exactly the ~40 files named below,
   not the 1,300+ the library ships.

   Outline files hardcode `stroke:#000` per shape; `outline()` swaps that for
   `currentColor` once here at module load, so colour then comes for free from
   the wrapping `<svg>`'s inherited `color` — the same way the old hand-drawn set
   took its colour from `stroke={c}`. Solid files carry no colour of their own —
   they inherit `fill` directly — so they skip that swap. */

 * flick of a trackpad, which is enough for a still to have decoded by the time
 * it matters and little enough that a nine-post feed does not fetch all nine.
 *
 * `now` is the escape hatch for the places where the deferral is pure cost —
 * a screen that renders exactly one clip and that clip is the reason you opened
 * the screen. It is folded into the returned value rather than the initial
 * state so a call site that computes it can still change its mind.
 *
 * The initial value is a fallback, not optimism: where there is no

 *
 * `blur` is a CSS filter rather than a second, pre-blurred file: a locked post

 * has to choose a candidate before layout exists, so absent a hint it assumes
 * the picture fills the viewport and takes the widest rung on the ladder — on a

 * a call site nobody has annotated yet paints exactly what it paints today.

/**
 * A silent, looping video with its own still behind it.
 *
 * `poster` is the photograph the loop was synthesised from, so the swap from
 * still to motion is invisible — same framing, same colour. Autoplay only ever
 * works muted, and these clips carry no audio track at all, so `muted` is not
 * a preference here: it is the only state that plays.
 *
 * `active` is what a snap feed drives. Only the reel on screen should be
 * decoding; the rest hold their poster frame.
 *
 * `active` governs playback; whether anything is fetched at all is a separate
 * question, and one the platform gives no help with. An `<img>` carries
 * `loading="lazy"` and the browser honours it. A `<video poster>` has no such
 * attribute — the poster is a full image fetched the moment the element parses,
 * so nine posts in a feed paid for nine photographs before a person had scrolled
 * past the first. So the element is handed nothing until `useNear` says it is
 * close, and `src` goes with `poster`: a poster with no video is a still that
 * never moves, a video with no poster is a hole while it buffers, and holding
 * both back also spares nine `preload="metadata"` range requests.
 *
 * Nothing goes blank in the meantime. The wrapper's gradient is seeded from the
 * path rather than fetched from it, so it is already painted, costs no network,
 * and is the same floor that has always been there behind a decoding poster —
 * which is why it reads the props and not the deferred values.
 *
 * `priority` is for a screen that renders exactly one clip and that clip is the
 * reason the screen was opened — a reel, a live stage. There is nothing below
 * the fold to save, and waiting a frame for the observer would put a gradient
 * where a cached still could have painted immediately.
 *
 * The poster is also sized, which `<video>` gives no help with at all: there is
 * no srcset and no sizes on the element, so a full-width photograph goes into
 * whatever box it is given. `rungFor` picks the rung instead, off a measured
 * width rather than a declared one, and the measuring is why `near` alone is no
 * longer enough to arm the element — the box has to exist first. That happens
 * in a layout effect, so the measure-then-arm round trip completes before the
 * browser paints: nothing flashes, and no poster is fetched at two sizes.
